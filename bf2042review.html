            <p>Battlefield 2042 is a first person shooter(FPS) developed by DICE and published by EA.<br>
                During the intial launch there was quite an upset as the game was lacking core features and 
                ultimately played rather poorly, espicially on last generation consoles such as Xbox one and Playstation 4. <br>
                Some of these issues included rendering issues as well as basic problems within gameplay such weapon balancing, 
                poor frames, and lack of content.
            </p>

            <p>Fortunately DICE has made several changes as well as added more content to better player experience, such as 
                adding weapons and maps from previous fan-loved entries such as Battlefield 3, Battlefield Bad Company 2 and others</p>

            <p>Some of these changes include</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixing performance issues</li>
                    <li>Upgrading servers to fix connection issues</li>
                    <li>scaling back some polygons and limiting render distances</li>
                </ul>

            <p>Now, aside from these issues and how they've been fixed, what type of person doesn't want to use a grappling 
                hook to fly behind a helicopter just to drop down on a tank to toss C4 to destroy it? <br>
                
                Or perhaps to use a crossbow to shoot an enemy helicopters pilot out of the cockpit?

            <p>Taking place within the mountains north of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, a landslide occured causing a 
                special research facility to be compromised. The research facility used by a coalition of US, Canadian, Mexican forces 
                is home to special weapons currently in development to aid the current war effort. The year is 2042, the worlds resources
                are dwindling as war and natural disasters ravage the world. The Coalition of North American forces constantly at battle
                with Russian forces, try to win the ever expanding power struggle.
            </p>

            <p>As you get ready to drop into combat, you select your soldier. Perhaps a demolitions expert known as "Liss"
                who originates from Poland or an ex seal team member from the United States known as "Irish", the choice
                is up to you as each character has different abilities which affect gameplay. Ranging from long range guided 
                rockets to a trophy system which destroys incoming explosives, the chosen soldier can affect your gameplay.
            </p>
            
            <p>Upon making land fall, you can choose to either call in transport which could be an jeep, APC, tank, or various 
                other vehicles which can assist you and your team in securing objectives and fighting enemy soldiers through-out the match.
                Once you and your squad are mobile, there's various objectives scattered throughout the map which you and your team
                will fight to gain control of. More objectives you secure and hold mean a better chance of victory, as Russian soldiers
                consistenly attack in a war of attrition.

                Battlefield 2042 was released on November 12, 2021 on PC, Xbox and Playstion.
