            <p>Sea of Thieves was released on March 20th of 2018. At the launch developer Rare had an excellent concept behind
            their new pirate game though Sea of Thieves launched as a relatively bare-bones title. With not much to do aside
            from just sailing around and fighting the occasional fort located on one of the many islands, the game stole
            the hearts of many within the Xbox community, including myself.

            Conceptualized through lore including that of the kraken and the meg, while taking idea's from pop culture like Pirates
            of the Caribbean, Rare created and brought to life a beautiful open world game where you can captain your own ship, 
            hunt for treasure, and enjoy the life of piracy.

        <h2>What kind of ships are in Sea of Thieves?</h2>
        <a name="ships"></a>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Sloop</td>
                    <td>Brig</td>
                    <td>Galleon</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1-2 players</td>
                    <td>2-3 players</td>
                    <td>3-4 players</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>myself, I prefer to sail on a Brig as it has a good combination of both speed and maneuverability. It's 
                the ideal ship for PVE(Player Vs Enviroment) and PVP(Player Vs Player), with me being a player that does
                enjoy both, I typically run the Brig. Now aside from ships, there's a ton of new content which has been added
                since launch such as
            </p>
